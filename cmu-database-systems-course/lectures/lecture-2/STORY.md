Some questions I had in mind
- What's the difference between views, nested queries and common table expressions? Are there any internal details and implementation and processing that differ? For example, some being more performant than the others. Or is it just a different way of doing things at user level - more of an alternative list of ways to provide inputs to the DB but internally it's all the same and executed the same way?
