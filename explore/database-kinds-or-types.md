Different kinds or types of databases

Structures and non-structured
- Relational or SQL. Usually tables - rows and columns
- NoSQL - anything not relational

SQL examples - PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL (MSSQL)

Under NoSQL, there are many kinds
- Graph DB
- Key Value DB / Store
- Document Store
- Wide Column - I need to research on this one a bit

There's also another kind, I think that's also NoSQL
- Time Series DB
