Different kinds or types of databases

Structures and non-structured
- Relational or SQL. Usually tables - rows and columns
- NoSQL - anything not relational

SQL examples - PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL (MSSQL)

Under NoSQL, there are many kinds
- Graph DB
- Key Value DB / Store
- Document Store
- Wide Column - I need to research on this one a bit

There's also another kind and few more, I think that's also NoSQL
- Time Series DB
- Databases that can help with Search Engine like features. For example ElasticSearch
- Data Analytics, Business Intelligence. Examples - Metabase
- DBs modelled around Geospatial data. Examples - PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension https://postgis.net/

There's also this thing called Multi Model that I hear a lot. One example I hear is FaunaDB, there's also ArangoDB

A small video on these - https://fireship.io/lessons/top-seven-database-paradigms/

A different way to categorize DBs would be according to their use case
- Analytics - Online Analytics Processing (OLAP)
- Transactions - Online Transaction Processing (OLAP)
- Hybrid of Analytics and Transaction - Hybrid Transaction Analytical Processing (HTAP)
