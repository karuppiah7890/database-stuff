Implement an existing database or parts of an existing database from scratch or from other projects. Some examples for existing databases that I can try to implement -
- Redis
- Splinter DB. This is pretty new, it's a research paper and there seems to one implementation for now
- Bolt DB
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB

This will help learn database topics behind the features of the database

Implementation language could be: Golang / C / C++ / Rust language

Things I can learn by practicing
- Tables and Indexes - data structures that one can use to store them on memory and disk
- Storage - disk access - reading and writing to the disk
- Networking for a database with client-server architecture
