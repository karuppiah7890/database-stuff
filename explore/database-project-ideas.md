Implement an existing database or parts of an existing database from scratch or from other projects. Some examples for existing databases that I can try to implement -
- Redis
- Splinter DB. This is pretty new, it's a research paper and there seems to one implementation for now
- Bolt DB
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MongoDB

This will help learn database topics behind the features of the database

Implementation language could be: Golang / C / C++ / Rust language

Things I can learn by practicing
- Tables and Indexes - data structures that one can use to store them on memory and disk
- Storage - disk access - reading and writing to the disk
- Networking for a database with client-server architecture

# Simple database

With following features
- Ability to store a table with only one primary key column and a few other columns like name, interests. Column types can be integer and string. No defined constraints on the size as of now, whatever works and is easy
- Ability to retrieve the table - complete and parts of the table using a simple query. Parts / single records using primary key

Things I'll learn from this
- How to create a simple query language, parse it, process it
- How to store data in the disk
- How to use indexes to search the disk fast
- I can try to do benchmark testing to see how the database performs in terms of data insertion, deletion and data search when there's a LOT of data
