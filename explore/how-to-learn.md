I was searching how to learn databases and distributed systems

https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=learning+databases+and+distributed+systems&ia=web

Found this interesting post https://www.teamblind.com/post/Learning-databases-and-distributed-systems-ahMBxJaG that resonated well with me, but I still haven't built any KV stores yet

And then found this https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan , looks like a gem!!

I have been also seeing if I can contribute to some database code to learn in the process !
