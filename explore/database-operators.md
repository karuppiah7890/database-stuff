Ideally automatic operators should automate
- Resizing disks
- Upgrading database from one version to another - including "skip upgrades", like v3 to v5 etc. This is not an easy thing though!
- Scaling clusters up and down based on user input or even automatically based on metrics that user provides as input
- Configure the database and any database clusters
- Take care of or help with high availability and resilience
