# Database Extensions List

Similar to databases list, this is just me listing out database extensions I come across or tried out or hear about

- [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com) - It's a postgres extension for a time series database
- [Jobmon](https://github.com/omniti-labs/pg_jobmon)
- [Partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman)
