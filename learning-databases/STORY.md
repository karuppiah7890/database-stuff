The best way to learn something is to read about it from books, blogs, articles and what not, practise things, see videos, have discussions. Basically just exploring

I'm gonna be writing down what all I do to learn about databases, especially learn them deep

But first, why? Why learn databases?

I mean, everyone is trying to learn how to scale microservices, scale very big systems, distributed systems, and work on different domains where they solve business problems.

From my understanding, not many are keen on learning very deep details about databases and similar softwares which are more like a blackbox. People just use it, and let it take care of whatever it is good at

For example I don't dig too much deep into git, though many do. I try to keep things simple and usually end up using the simple features of git, and never really had the use case for using the harder or complex commands or needed to understand those

Why do people read those though? Well, it provides some understanding, some ideas, some concepts :) So, learning deeper can prove to be useful when we want to learn how the software / system works and want to apply the same philosophy or similar ideas in another place. Understanding systems, understanding history, understanding the reasoning behind decisions in softwares and systems are very useful sometimes, that way, history won't repeat itself - historical mistakes can be avoided, also, we might not have to reinvent the wheel and can take inspiration from other systems ! :)

Also, many softwares and systems are not so easy to understand and learn. Probably many deem it to be a blackbox for this reason. I'm not sure though

Though what makes databases an interesting topic is, if you think about it, everyone wants to just deploy their database and use it and use it efficiently - performant SQL queries, performant DB after fine tuning settings, using extensions / plugins for extra features etc. They probably don't go and check too much about how databases are built or work or it's history. Maybe some might, for knowing how to efficiently use the database

Given that many developers simply want a database as a service (DBaaS) and just wanna forget about Databases, I see it as a valuable thing to learn and understand at a deeper level

I remember one ex-colleague mentioning something along the lines of - People always think about microservices and think it's stateless and think how it can be scaled how much ever one wants. The reality is, if the microservice has a database, then the database is a bottleneck for scaling. If the database cannot scale, simply horizontally scaling the microservices alone won't work!!

My ex-colleague was pretty much a genius in Databases, haha. He spoke about Write Ahead Logs (WAL), CAP theorem etc

It made me wonder about how cool databases are! I never got around to learning it though, at least not at a deep level

Some of my colleagues were even planning on creating a database ;)

So, it's also in my list

The thing I'm trying to do is - learn some really hard concepts, that many shy away from or consider a black box. Especially a set of concepts that are vast. Databases have been there for a long time

Fast forward to today, a lot of companies rely on databases, data services. Especially database as a service (DBaaS) services, or are managing their own databases - probably even struggling to do so, as it's not so easy ðŸ˜…

There are special roles called Database Administrators. I'm not sure what all they do. I'm guessing they know Databases to a good extent. I have read one set of responsibilities as - optimizing queries, fine tuning databases and managing all the hosted databases

Anyways, I'm going to try a hand at understanding different kinds of databases. Their use cases and implementations and algorithms and concepts behind the scenes :) Maybe even read research papers!! :)

I have a list of databases that I can start off with. I also plan to build a database, haha. Let's see how that goes :P

I'm looking forward to learning in depth about all the interesting terms that I have heard a lot. Distributed systems, Network Partitioning, CAP theorem, Consensus, Eventual Consistency, Strong consistency among many others
