Recently I have been thinking about what all I want to learn - topics and how I can learn them and why I want to learn them especially

Rust - Why? I want to learn Rust because I keep hearing that it's really good and can really compete with C/C++ which dominates the world of "fast software" or "performant software" including databases and distributed systems from what I see in some repos. For example, Redis is written in C and some C++ - https://github.com/redis/redis. RocksDB is written in C++ and some C - https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb. Where can I learn Rust? There are so many resources as usual like any other topic or technology or programming language. Some of then ones I have heard of are - the popular open Rust book which has been mentioned here https://www.rust-lang.org/learn and then paid books like "The Rust Programming Language" and other popular books. And then the popular Exercism site https://exercism.org/ which also had a overhaul recently and looks slick! I think Exercism can help me learn and practice Rust apart from other resources like books and other references in https://www.rust-lang.org/learn !

DevOps and SRE - Why? It's the buzz word in the software world especially in operations (ops) world. I don't know much so I'm going to have to learn to understand what's all the buzz about and see if it's really helpful to learn these, to have a common language to talk in and also learn some strategies and practices in the real world while maintaining services at large scale, including database services. Where can I learn it from? I was thinking Google's SRE books 1 and 2. I have book 2, the workbook, as a physical book. Book 1 is free online - https://sre.google/sre-book/table-of-contents/. Actually book 2 is free too! I just noticed - https://sre.google/workbook/table-of-contents/. There's also another book mentioned - https://sre.google/static/pdf/building_secure_and_reliable_systems.pdf "Building Secure & Reliable Systems". There are more books about DevOps. And there's this one book I saw about Database SRE - "Database Reliability Engineering" - https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/database-reliability-engineering/9781491925935/ 

Database stuff - Why? It's like the thing that I have been wanting to learn! It's a hard topic, I know. Probably not something many might be learning or working on. People usually work at the level of a web service, mobile app, that use databases, or an application that doesn't need a database! Like a tool, or application with some simple small local database that doesn't have some client server architecture. But I want to learn database because it seems like a hard topic and pretty interesting too because it's hard and there are lots of challenges and not a lot of people are working on database stuff. Where can I learn about databases? Well, there are a few books I have heard about. Database internals - https://www.databass.dev/ , I have this ebook. Another popular book is - "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" - https://dataintensive.net/ which I have too as an ebook. I have heard a lot of praise about the book and about how it teaches a lot about data stuff including databases. So yeah, I think it's gonna be great!

Now that I have some topics in mind and the resources I want to look at, I think I better start looking at them ;) and learning them than just thinking about learning! ;)

There are some interesting topics in this thread - https://twitter.com/ifesdjeen/status/1432057249418125324
