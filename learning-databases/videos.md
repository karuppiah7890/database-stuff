https://www.youtube.com/c/HusseinNasser-software-engineering - Lot of interesting database content and backend content in this channel!

A cool playlist from the above channel with some cool videos - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQnljOFTspQXjD0HOzN7P2tgzu7scWpl2

Some videos in this playlist are members only which I'll probably pay for and checkout sometime
