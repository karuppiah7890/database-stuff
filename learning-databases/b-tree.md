I was looking at this video to understand some basics

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOb1tuEZ2X4

It was good!

This is another nice video - https://youtu.be/aZjYr87r1b8 !

Some questions on the top of my mind
- How are disk blocks and files related? Since everything on systems are stored in the form of files on the disk [Question]
- What is the size of the disk block on a system? How do I find it? For example on Linux, or MacOS, or Windows. [Question]
- Do Databases find the system's disk block size? and then accordingly store the data on the disk? Using files that is [Question]
- Is disk block based on the disk? or the system? Like, operating system / kernel. Or is it based on the file system? [Question]
- Do databases store all their data in a single file? [Question]

I'm also wondering how databases work on data concurrently, I mean, if there are multiple cores used by the database program, or if there are multiple instances of the database program each using one core, or even multiple cores. Things seem to get pretty complicated. I guess multiple instances of the database program would mean a distributed system, and hence a distributed database. For one database program using multiple cores and all data in the same system - I'm wondering how requests are concurrently handled. How things work, like locks, transactions etc. There are also different kinds of transactions - 2 phase commit etc etc. Sounds pretty complicated to do all of that stuff when you have to first read from the disk and store it in memory and also ensure that the data is not dirty - some other request updating it concurrently on the disk after finishing processing in the memory. Phew.

I couldn't find the block size on Linux because of some issues

I had asked `Is disk block based on the disk? or the system? Like, operating system / kernel. Or is it based on the file system?` [Question]

So, to answer my question about block size and whose property / attribute it is - it is the attribute of a file system. At least that's what I just read. For example over here

https://alvinalexander.com/misc/how-determine-macos-linux-filesystem-block-size/

```bash
database-stuff $ docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash

This shows some hardware level data and shows block size. Also, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZjYr87r1b8 mentioned that the block size is dependent on the manufacturer - assuming it's the hardware manufacturer, then it must be the disk block size. So, disk's property? ðŸ¤”

Wow. I just read this http://www.linuxintro.org/wiki/Blocks,_block_devices_and_block_sizes . It says that there are block sizes for disks, file systems AND kernel ;) Wow.

So, I guess that answers my question with a vague answer that's not yet clear. Funny how I thought kernel might be at play here when I was like "nah, most probably not.."

I'll come back and check more on my question I think!

`Is disk block based on the disk? or the system? Like, operating system / kernel. Or is it based on the file system?` [Question]

I was checking how to find the block size when running code, let's say in Golang

https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=find+block+size+in+golang&ia=web&iax=qa

Found this small thing https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46558824/how-do-i-get-a-block-devices-size-correctly-in-go#46559181

I was thinking there might be some standard library, like file system, with which I can get the block size in all platforms, with programming language capabilities. But yeah, I don't know what block size all of these are, that I'm seeing

golang standard library - https://duckduckgo.com/?q=golang+file+system+standard+library&t=ffab&ia=web

https://pkg.go.dev/std

https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs@go1.17

https://pkg.go.dev/io/ioutil@go1.17

https://pkg.go.dev/internal/poll@go1.17

https://pkg.go.dev/testing/fstest@go1.17

Hmm, I couldn't find anything when searching for `block`, hmm

Some questions I had in mind

What's the hardware disk block size of disks in the cloud? [Question]

Will golang syscall to find block size work in all platforms? Or just Linux? And what block size is it? File system block size? [Question]

What do the different block sizes mean? In disk at hardware level, in file system and in kernel, for example in Linux [Question]
